About performance - tips and tricks
If you are still experiencing low FPS with the pack, consider compressing the grasstextures further down, or use less patches of grass. You can adjust the amount of grass displayed in the Terrain asset settings. 

For those who own a GPU powerful enough to display more high-res grass and branches, the pack still has the high resolution textures, you just need to reverse the compression inside Unity. Simply select all the textures and turn the Max Size up to 1024 for the grass and 2048 for the branches.

Be advised though, the higher resolution grass you use, the smaller amount you will able to draw. 

An other workaround is to angle the camera in ways that won't let multiple grass planes line up. Slowdown happens when multiple alpha planes are lining up, taxing a lot on the GPU.
